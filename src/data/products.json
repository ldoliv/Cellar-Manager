        "comment": "This is tightly packed, with sleek, pure, driven notes of cassis, plum reduction and blackberry puree allied to an iron spine, while subtle alder, juniper, sweet bay leaf and tobacco notes peek in throughout. Very fine-grained, but impressively sturdy in feel, with a long, lingering note of iron piercing the finish. For the cellar. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024 through 2040. 4,000 cases made. - JM"

        "comment": "The core of cherry and currant is framed by notes of hay, eucalyptus and wild thyme, with a solid structure that leaves a dusty feel, offset by the sweet, ripe fruit. Balanced overall, this is  built for the long haul. Best from 2023 through 2045. 3,100 cases made, 1,000 cases imported. - BS"

        "comment": "Unctuous and fine-grained flavors of dark currant and ripe cherry are supported by medium-grained tannins in this red, which is creamy midpalate, with concentrated chocolate mousse notes on the finish. Drink now through 2026. 13,000 cases made, 7,000 cases imported. - KM"
